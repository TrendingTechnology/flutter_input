Example app using package `flutter_input`.

Runs on Android, iOS and Web.

## Description
All input widgets from package `flutter_input` are
integrated into one single form. The fields are distributed
over multiple tabs in a tab view.

### Localization
This example is localized (currently only english and german).
It uses _I18n_extension_ to localize all texts in this package.
It still relies on Flutter localization for all Flutter widgets.

To change the language in the example, open the drawer
and select the desired target language.
