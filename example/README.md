Example app uses package `flutter_input`.

Runs on Android, iOS and Web.

## Description
All input widgets (fields) from package `flutter_input` are
integrated into one single form. The fields are distributed
over multiple tabs in a tab view.

The multitab example shows how to explicictly enable input
fields for editing and saving or discarding them when finished.

The drawer contains a dialog `settings` which shows how to
edit data immediately (without enable / save / cancel).

## Localization
This example is localized (english and german).
It uses _I18n_extension_ to localize all texts in this package
but still relies on Flutter localization for all Flutter widgets.

To change the language in the example, open the drawer
and select the desired target language.
