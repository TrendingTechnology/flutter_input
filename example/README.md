Example app using package `flutter_input`.

Runs on Android, iOS and Web.

#### Localization
This example is localized.
It uses _I18n_extension_ to localize all code in this package,
because it keeps the code much better readable. It still
relies on Flutter localization for all Flutter widgets.

The language can be changed anywhere in the sample with
immediate redraw. See how `InputLangauge` is used in
`Drawer` in file `main.dart`.
